1. Dataset initially contained missing values (<1%) which were handled using median imputation.
2. Score distributions showed slight right skew, especially in math scores.
3. Outliers were detected using the IQR method.
4. Instead of removing outliers, values were capped to preserve dataset size.
5. Strong positive correlation observed between reading and writing scores.
6. Weak-to-moderate correlation between math and reading scores.
7. Cleaned dataset is suitable for further modeling or analysis.
